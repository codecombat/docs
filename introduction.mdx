## Basics

- Examples are in JavaScript on a Node/Express server with
  [request](https://github.com/request/request) installed.
- Request and responses are in JSON
- API responses are the base resource being created/referenced. So, for example,
  all routes starting with `/api/users` return [User](/users/post-users)
  resources.

## Client Setup

We currently do not have a way for you to create or set up your own API Client
or OAuth Provider information. Please contact us directly to get started.

## Client Authentication

API routes must be called with Basic HTTP Authentication. You will receive a
username (CLIENT_ID) and password (CLIENT_SECRET) upon creation of your API
Client in our system. Provide those credentials with each API request.

`url = 'https://codecombat.com/api/users'`<br />
`json = { name: 'A username' }`<br />
`auth = { name: CLIENT_ID, pass: CLIENT_SECRET }`<br />
`request.get({ url, json, auth }, (err, res) => console.log(res.statusCode, res.body))`

We strongly recommend using a secrets manager for storing your client secret.
Plain text files like dotenv lead to accidental, costly leaks. Use
[Doppler](https://www.doppler.com/) for a developer-friendly experience. AWS and
Google Cloud have native solutions as well.

## User Authentication

To authenticate a user on CodeCombat through your service, you will need to use
the below OAuth 2 process. CodeCombat will act as the client, and your service
will act as the provider. First, you will need to provide a trusted lookup URL
and/or a token URL for the setup(See Client Setup above). Then the process from
user account creation to log in will look like this:

1. **Create the user** using [POST /api/users](/users/post-users).
2. **Link the CodeCombat user to an OAuth identity** using
   [POST /api/users/:handle/o-auth-identities](/users/post-o-auth-identities).
   You can call this API with a code or an access token. If no access token is
   given, we will use the token URL to exchange the given code for an access
   token. Then we call the lookup URL with the access token to receive the user
   information (id) from your system which is saved to the user in our db.
3. **Log the user in** by redirecting them to [/auth/login-o-auth](/auth/login).
   You can call this API with the code/access token, and we will get the user
   information from your system similarly to step 2. Finally, we match this
   information with what is stored in our database in step 2. If everything
   checks out, the user is logged in and redirected to the home page.

There is also a
[concrete example](https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.codecombat.com/codecombat_oauth_example.tar.gz)
depicting the above process for better understanding. You can also refer to this
[diagram](https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.codecombat.com/Example_OAuth_Flow.png).
