openapi: "GET /auth/login-o-auth"
description: "Logs a user in."

```
url = `https://codecombat.com/auth/login-o-auth?provider=${OAUTH_PROVIDER_ID}&accessToken=1234`
res.redirect(url)
// User is sent to this CodeCombat URL and assuming everything checks out,
// is logged in and redirected to the home page.
```

In this example, we call your lookup URL (letâ€™s say,
`https://oauth.provider/user?t=<%= accessToken %>`) with the access token
(1234). The lookup URL returns `{ id: 'abcd' }` in this case. We will match this
id with the OAuthIdentity stored in the user information in our db. If
everything checks out, the user is logged in and redirected to the home page.
